Artist Statement:
Orbital Dialogues is a moving artwork that connects art and space technology. Placed at the entrance of a science museum, it shows how Earth and satellites share data by turning invisible signals into a display of lights and motion. The sculpture works like a satellite on the ground, with antennas that move back and forth, LCD screens that list satellites and their missions in real time, and motors that rotate the whole structure. Using real nanosatellite data from different countries, "Orbital Dialogues" highlights the hidden networks that power modern communication and exploration. It takes the complex world of space technology and makes it more understandable, inspiring curiosity and learning. The combination of moving parts, lights, and live data offers a glimpse into the constant overhead exchanges. "Orbital Dialogues" aims to spark wonder and encourage people to explore the field of STEM. It reminds visitors that even the unseen parts of our world, like the satellites quietly circling above, can come alive through the blend of art and science.
